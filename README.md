# Hass consultant limited

I have been working for Hass Consulting Company, which is a real estate leader with over 25 years of experience,
as a Data Scientist. I have been tasked to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information
on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months. I will then create a model that would allow the 
company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.
